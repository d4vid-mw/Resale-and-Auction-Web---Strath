RESALE AND AUCTION WEB BASED SYSTEM FOR STRATHMORE STUDENTS
so basically the problem with the code is on list product place bid and the search product where in implementing the process and also on list product after the seller inserts the product we are finding it difficult to make it display on the search product

HEY Michael . you would like to enter the product an see it in the product list ? = product search?

basically we want after the seller has listed it should be displayed on the search product.

Can you give me your number where I can chat with you using whatapp or Signal ? 

Are you using seller - buyer - product tables ? 

we have three tables up to now but we are also suppose to have a table for the bid since there must be a database which stores the bids place.
